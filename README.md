# Sub-word modeling and convolutional networks 

In this repository, we will be exploring two key concepts: sub-word modeling and convolutional networks for NLP tasks. We will apply these concepts to a natural machine translation model. This notebook is solution to coding sections of [Assignment #5](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1194/assignments/a5.pdf) of Stanford's ["CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning"](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) course. Contents of this notebook are taken from the course materials. <br>
